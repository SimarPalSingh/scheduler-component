# scheduler-component
Project using the SyncFusion scheduler component for Bhaiyya's app 

### Current progress:
For the **Client side**, the calendar view has been set up using the SyncFusion library and i am unable to store
the data passed from an entry on the calendar to the MongoDB database.

For the **Server side**: the connection to MongoDB works fine so far. Need to work out a way to store the data
from the front end on to the DB.
